# Predicting-stress-using-wearable-sensors-Nurses-
Predicting stress using wearable sensors (Nurses) is a Data science project that involves analysing nurse data collected from wearable sensor device to develop a machine learning model to predict stress from nurse activities. The dataset can be downloaded from https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.5hqbzkh6f. The 1.unzip_script.py is used to unzip all the nurses dataset. The 2.combine_data_script is used to combine the entire variables of a nurse together. The 3.merge_data_script is to merge all nurses data together. The label_data_sript is use to lable the dataset.

The CE888 code.ipynb is the jupyter code that contains the analytics and the machine learning model.
